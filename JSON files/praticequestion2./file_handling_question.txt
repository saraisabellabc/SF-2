Short Answer:

Write a Python function that opens a text file called `data.txt`, reads all lines, and returns the number of lines that contain the word "error" (case insensitive).

Constraints:
- Do not use comprehensions, filter, map, enumerate, global variables, or `with` when opening the file.
- Assume that the file `data.txt` exists in the same directory and contains plain text.

Example content of data.txt:
----------------------------
This is a test.
An error has occurred.
All systems go.
Another ERROR found.

Expected output: 2
